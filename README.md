# Source Code for Image Analysis

This is a repository associated with manuscript "Chromatin Compaction During Confined Cell Migration Induces and Reshapes Nuclear Condensates" by Zhao et al, submitted to Nature Communications, and all subsequent version of the manuscript. It includes MATLAB scripts for all analyzing fluorescence intensity, software used to perform particle imaging velocimetry [PIVlab](https://pivlab.blogspot.com/), pairwise MSD analysis for microrheology experiments, and intracellular phase diagram mapping with SVM-based classifications of phase-separated vs non-phase separated data.
